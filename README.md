# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition
Handwritten Digit Recognition using Fully Connected and Convolutional Neural Networks

Overview
This repository contains an implementation of MNIST Digits Classification using a Fully Connected Neural Network. 
The project aims to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using a simple neural network architecture.

Description
In this project, we implement a neural network - a Fully Connected Neural Network, to perform handwritten digit classification. 
The MNIST database, containing images of handwritten digits (0 to 9), serves as the training and testing dataset for our model. 
The MNIST dataset is widely used in the field of machine learning and image processing.

Requirements
Python 3.x
PyTorch
NumPy
Matplotlib
